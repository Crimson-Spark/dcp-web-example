# Perfect Triangle Numbers

Triangular numbers are a pattern of numbers that form equilateral triangles. Each subsequent number in the sequence adds a new row of dots to the triangle.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2, and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

This application finds all of the perfect triangle numbers in a given interval `[1, b]`.
